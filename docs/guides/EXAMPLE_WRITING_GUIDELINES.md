## 4. Prompt Engineering Integration

### 4.1 Few-Shot Learning Principles

Examples are used for **in-context learning** - Claude learns patterns from examples.

**Effective few-shot examples:**
1. **Diverse scenarios** - Cover common + edge cases
2. **Consistent format** - Same structure across examples
3. **Progressive complexity** - Easy → Medium → Hard
4. **Pattern highlighting** - Make key techniques obvious

### 4.2 Prompting Techniques (Module 11 Integration)

**Techniques to demonstrate in examples:**

| Technique | Use In Examples | Effectiveness |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Show step-by-step reasoning | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical |
| **ReAct (Reason+Act)** | Demonstrate tool use with reasoning | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical |
| **Self-Consistency** | Show verification steps | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| **Least-to-Most** | Break complex problems | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| **Self-Refinement** | Show iteration/improvement | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |

**Example incorporating CoT:**
```markdown
## Claude Response

Let me analyze this step-by-step:

**Step 1: Understand Requirements**
- Input: User data (name, age)
- Output: Filtered list of adults
- Constraint: Handle missing data

**Step 2: Identify Issues**
- Current code uses dict access → KeyError risk
- No validation → crash on None input

**Step 3: Design Solution**
- Use .get() with defaults
- Add type hints
- Validate input at boundary

**Step 4: Implementation**
[Code with fixes]
```

### 4.3 Response Structure Patterns

**Standard response format (adapt per domain):**

```markdown
## Claude Response

### [1. Understanding/Analysis]
[Parse request, identify requirements, state assumptions]

### [2. Planning/Design]
[Approach, alternatives considered, chosen solution]

### [3. Implementation]
[Code/commands/configuration]

### [4. Verification/Testing]
[How to test, expected output, edge cases]

### [5. Recommendations/Next Steps]
[Optional improvements, related considerations]
```

**Length by section:**
- Understanding: 10-15% of response
- Planning: 15-20%
- Implementation: 40-50%
- Verification: 15-20%
- Recommendations: 5-10%

### 4.4 Key Takeaways Section

**Purpose:** Explicit pattern extraction for learning

**Format:**
```markdown
## Key Takeaways

- **Pattern 1:** [Specific technique demonstrated]
  - Example: "Always validate input at system boundaries"
- **Pattern 2:** [Decision-making criterion]
  - Example: "Prefer composition over inheritance for flexibility"
- **Pattern 3:** [Domain-specific best practice]
  - Example: "Run secrets detection before git commit"
```

**Guidelines:**
- 2-5 takeaways per example
- Specific, not generic ("Use .get()" vs "Write good code")
- Actionable and memorable

## 5. Domain Prompt Context

### 5.1 What Are Domain Prompts

Domain prompts are system-level context files injected alongside the session when a specific domain profile is active. As of 2026-03-22, there are 12 domain prompts:

| # | Domain | Prompt file | Coverage |
|---|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | security | `security.md` | Pentesting, vulnerability analysis, OWASP |
| 2 | dfir | `dfir.md` | Incident response, forensics, triage |
| 3 | devops | `devops.md` | Infrastructure, CI/CD, containers |
| 4 | compliance | `compliance.md` | ISO/ГОСТ/ФЗ, audit, controls |
| 5 | osint | `osint.md` | Reconnaissance, data aggregation |
| 6 | network | `network.md` | Protocols, traffic analysis, enumeration |
| 7 | reverse_engineering | `reverse_engineering.md` | Binary analysis, disassembly, RE workflows |
| 8 | business_analysis | `business_analysis.md` | Requirements, stakeholder analysis, BPM |
| 9 | procurement | `procurement.md` | Vendor evaluation, contracts, supply chain |
| 10 | orchestration | `orchestration.md` | Multi-agent coordination, task routing |
| 11 | mcp | `mcp.md` | MCP server development and integration |
| 12 | coding_agents | `coding_agents.md` | Agent-centric development patterns |

### 5.2 Implications for Example Authors

When a domain prompt is active, the model already has context about that domain's terminology, workflow constraints, and tooling. Examples written for that domain:

- **Do not need to re-introduce basic domain concepts** — the domain prompt covers them.
- **Should demonstrate patterns not covered by the generic domain prompt** — focus on edge cases, nuanced workflows, and patterns that need calibration.
- **May reference domain prompt conventions** — for example, a security example can reference the scope-verification structure defined in the security domain prompt without redefining it.

### 5.3 Multi-Domain Examples

When an example spans two domain prompts (e.g., `security + devops` for a Kubernetes security audit), note this in the metadata:

```markdown
**Domain:** Security + DevOps
**Domain Prompts:** security, devops
```

This signals to the reader that both domain profiles should be active when using the example as a few-shot reference.

## 6. Output Style Awareness

### 6.1 Output Styles Overview

Claude Code supports 7 Output Styles, selected via `/config`. The active style changes response structure, verbosity, and framing:

| Style | Primary use | Response characteristics |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `operator` | Default production use | Concise, action-first, structured tables |
| `documentation` | Writing docs, guides | Prose-heavy, Diátaxis structure, cross-references |
| `learning` | Teaching, onboarding | Explanatory, analogies, progressive disclosure |
| `research` | Investigation, analysis | Evidence-cited, multi-perspective, hedged claims |
| `pair-programming` | Live coding sessions | Incremental, IDE-aware, diff-focused |
| `incident` | On-call, DFIR | Timeline-first, severity-tagged, action-oriented |
| `architecture` | System design | C4/arc42 notation, ADR format, trade-off tables |

### 6.2 Writing Style-Agnostic Examples

Few-shot examples are loaded as context regardless of which Output Style is active. This means a single example may be read in an `operator` session, a `learning` session, or an `incident` session.

**Guidelines for style-agnostic examples:**

1. **Do not hardcode a response preamble that assumes a specific style.** A `learning`-style preamble with lengthy explanations will look wrong in an `operator` session.

2. **Use the "Claude Response" section to demonstrate the _content_ pattern, not the _formatting_ style.** The Output Style controls formatting; the example controls content structure.

3. **If an example is specifically calibrating a single style**, note it in the metadata:

```markdown
**Output Style:** documentation
**Note:** This example demonstrates Diátaxis how-to structure. In other styles the response format will differ, but the content sections (prerequisites, steps, verification) remain relevant.
```

4. **For high-complexity examples (>1500 words)**, consider providing two response variants — one showing `operator` brevity, one showing `documentation` depth — to illustrate how the same content adapts.

### 6.3 Style-Specific Example Domains

Some domains map naturally to a specific Output Style. When writing examples for these domains, document the intended style:

| Domain | Recommended Output Style |
|--------|--------------------------|
| DFIR / incident response | `incident` |
| API documentation | `documentation` |
| Architecture decisions | `architecture` |
| Onboarding tutorials | `learning` |
| Live debugging sessions | `pair-programming` |
| OSINT / research tasks | `research` |
| Operational tasks (deploy, audit, scan) | `operator` |

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### 8.1 Common Mistakes

**❌ DON'T:**

1. **Toy Problems:**
   ```markdown
   ❌ "Write a function to print 'Hello World'"
   ✅ "Write a CLI tool for log parsing with filtering"
   ```

2. **Over-Specification:**
   ```markdown
   ❌ "Create a class named UserManager with methods add_user,
       delete_user, and update_user taking parameters..."
   ✅ "Our app needs user management. Currently using a dict,
       but need better structure as we add features."
   ```

3. **Perfect Code Only:**
   ```markdown
   ❌ Only showing flawless final solution
   ✅ Show analysis of flawed code → improvements
   ```

4. **No Context:**
   ```markdown
   ❌ "Fix this bug: [code]"
   ✅ "Our e-commerce checkout fails for users with coupons.
       Error: KeyError on 'discount'. Code: [...]"
   ```

5. **Missing Takeaways:**
   ```markdown
   ❌ Example ends with code
   ✅ Example ends with "Key Takeaways" section
   ```

### 8.2 Quality Issues

**Red flags during review:**

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Code doesn't run | ❌ Critical | Test before submission |
| Unrealistic scenario | 🟡 Medium | Add context, constraints |
| No best practices | 🟡 Medium | Highlight domain standards |
| Missing error handling | 🟡 Medium | Add try/except, validation |
| No explanation | 🟡 Medium | Add "Why" for each decision |

### 8.3 Style Violations

**Common formatting errors:**
```markdown
❌ No language in code block: ```
✅ Language specified: ```python

❌ Inconsistent heading levels
✅ H2 for sections, H3 for subsections

❌ Metadata missing or incomplete
✅ All three fields: Domain, Task Type, Complexity
```
